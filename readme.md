# Typescript + Express mini project

## Purpose
This project is a tutorial I did to learn more about how back-end works with Express.
I used MongoDB as the database and followed this [tutorial](https://itnext.io/building-restful-web-apis-with-node-js-express-mongodb-and-typescript-part-1-2-195bdaf129cf) by Dale Nguyen.
